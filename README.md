The popularity of the optical networks is increasing with the help of large bandwidth offer of optical fiber. As the light is carried in n different wavelengths in a single fiber, a virtual toplogy should be designed to establish connections between the end-users. Virtual topology design problem aims to design va virtual topology which can establish the connections for the given matrix over a physical network. This physical network has nodes that contains equipments like transmitters, receivers and optical cross-connects that will all affect the design of the virtual topology. The pure virtual topology design problem is not realistic because of the impairments in the physical layer. With this project, physical impairment awared virtual topology design problem is solved while considering physical constraints of *Amplified Spontaneous Emission in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers* and *crosstalk noise* at optical cross-connects. **Adaptive iterated construction search method** is prosed to solve physical impairment awared virtual topology design. Also new routing and wavelength assignment approaches are propsed which are **Tabu Based Hyper Heuristic** and **Ant Colony Optimizastion Based Hyper Heuristic** to overcome the impairments occured in the physical layer. The aim is to maximize the trafic scale up while minimizing the total bir error rate of all the routed lightpaths over optical wavelength division multiplexing networks.
